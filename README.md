## Introduction

WFB-ng client (Video Decoder) for Rockchip platform powered by the [Rockchip MPP library](https://github.com/rockchip-linux/mpp).
It also displays a simple cairo based OSD that shows the bandwidth, decoding latency, and framerate of the decoded video, and wfb-ng link statistics.
Current version of the project mainely adapted for embedded platforms.

This project is based on a unique frozen development [FPVue_rk](https://github.com/gehee/FPVue_rk) by [Gee He](https://github.com/gehee) and
it was forked from [OpenIPC](https://github.com/OpenIPC/PixelPilot_rk) project.

Tested on RK3566 (Radxa Zero 3W) and RK3588s (Orange Pi 5).

### OSD config

OSD is set-up declaratively in `/etc/pixelpilot/config_osd.json` file (or whatever is set via `--osd-config`)
command line key.

OSD is described as an array of widgets which may subscribe to fact updates (they receive each fact
update they subscribe to) and those widgets are periodically rendered on the screen (in the order they
declared in config). So the goal is that widgets would decide how they should be rendered based on
the values of the facts they are subscribed to. If widget needs to render not the latest value of the
fact, but some processed value (like average / max / total etc), the widget should keep the necessary
state for that. There is a helper class `MovingAverage` that would be helpful to calculate common
statistical parameters.

Each fact has a specific datatype: one of `int` (signed integer) / `uint` (unsigned integer) /
`double` (floating point) / `bool` (true/false) / `string` (text). Type cast is currently not
implemented, so it is important to use the right type in the widget code and templates.

Facts may also have tags: a set of string key->value pairs. Widget may filter facts by tags as well as by name.
Currently there are several generic OSD widgets and several specific ad-hoc ones. There are quite a
lot of facts to which widgets can subscribe to:

| Fact                           | Type | Description                                                               |
|:-------------------------------|:-----|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dvr.recording`                | bool | Is DVR currently recording?                                               |
| `video.width`                  | uint | The width of the video stream                                             |
| `video.height`                 | uint | The height of the video stream                                            |
| `video.displayed_frame`        | uint | Published  with value "1" each time a new video frame is displayed        |

| `rtp.received_bytes`           | uint | Number of bytes received from rtp stream (published for each packet)      |

Pixelpilot is also able to connect to WFB-ng statistics API and extract some of the facts from there.

#### Widgets

Currently we have generic widgets and more ad-hoc specific ones. Generic widgets normally can be used
to display any fact (as long as datatype matches):

* `TextWidget` - displays a static string of text
* `IconWidget` - displays a graphical icon
* `IconTextWidget` - displays a graphical icon followed by a static text
* `TplTextWidget` - displays a string of text by replacing placeholders with the fact values
* `IconTplTextWidget` - displays a graphical icon followed by templatized text string
* `IconTplStatusWidget` - displays a graphical icon that visualized in white or gray color and text by replacing placeholders with the fact values
* `BoxWidget` - displays a static square. Might be good as a background.
* `BarChartWidget` - displays a simple bar chart for the single fact's statistics. Each bar represents
 either minimum or maximum or sum or count or average of the fact over time interval. Can be used to show
 eg the average video bitrate or RSSI or FPS.
* `PopupWidget` - displays a stacked pop-ups with text facts which fade-away after timeout.
* `DebugWidget` - displays debug information (name, type, tags, value) about fact(s)
* `ExternalSurfaceWidget` - TBD
* `IconSelectorWidget` - display a icon based on a fact's value
* `IconStatusWidget` - displays a graphical icon that visualized in white or gray color
* `TimeWidget` - displays the current date and time.

Specific widgets expect quite concrete facts as input:

* `DvrStatusWidget` - shows up when DVR is recording and is hidden when not.
  Uses `dvr.recording` fact
* `DvrStorageWidget` - shows available DVR storage space and displays an error state when storage is unavailable or low on space.
  Uses `dvr.storage_status` and `dvr.storage_available_bytes` facts.
* `VideoWidget` - shows FPS and video resolution.
  Uses `video.displayed_frame`, `video.width`, `video.height` facts
* `VideoBitrateWidget` - shows video bitrate (not radio link, but video!).
  Uses `rtp.received_bytes` fact
* `VideoDecodeLatencyWidget` - shows video frame decode and display latency (avg/min/max).
  Uses `video.decode_and_handover_ms` fact
* `GPSWidget` - displays GPS fix type (no fix / 2D fix / 3D fix etc) and GPS coordinates.
  Uses `gps_raw.fix_type`, `gps_raw.lat` and `gps_raw.lon` facts

## Known issues

1. Video is cropped when the fpv feed resolution is bigger than the screen mode.
2. Crashes when video feed resolution is higher than the screen resolution.

## The way it works

It uses `rtp` library (https://github.com/ireader/media-server.git) to read the RTP media stream from UDP or Unix domain socket.
It uses `mpp` library to decode MPEG frames using Rockchip hardware decoder.
It uses [Direct Rendering Manager (DRM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Rendering_Manager) to
display video on the screen, see `drm.c`.
It uses `cairo` library to draw OSD elements (if enabled), see `osd.c`.
It re-encodes decoded frames to H265 with the Rockchip hardware encoder and muxes them to MPEG-TS as
DVR (if enabled), so recording works regardless of the source codec. TS is append-only and carries
no index, so a recording cut short by a power loss stays playable up to the last flushed byte.

Pixelpilot starts several threads:

* main thread:
  controls rtplib which reads RTP, extracts MPEG frames and feeds them to the MPP hardware decoder
* DVR_THREAD (if enabled):
  reads frames and start/stop/shutdown commands from a mutex-protected `std::queue`, encodes each
  frame to H265 with the MPP hardware encoder and muxes it to MPEG-TS. Frames come either from
  `FRAME_THREAD` (clean video, zero-copy from the decoder) or from `DISPLAY_THREAD` (with
  `--dvr-osd`: the composited video+OSD output captured through the DRM writeback connector).
  Disk writes are offloaded again to an internal writer thread so an SD stall does not drop frames.
  It yields on a condition variable for the DVR queue
* FRAME_THREAD:
  reads decoded video frames from MPP hardware decoder and forwards them to `DISPLAY_THREAD`
  through DRM `output_list` protected by `video_mutex`.
  Seems that thread vields on `mpi->decode_get_frame()` call waiting for HW decoder to return a new frame
* DISPLAY_THREAD:
  reads decoded frames and OSD from `video_mutex`-protected `output_list` and calls `drm*` functions to
  render them on the screen.
  The loop yields on `video_mutex` and `video_cond` waiting for a new frame to
  display from FRAME_THREAD
* WFBCLI_THREAD (if OSD is enabled):
  connects to the local WFB instance stats API, reads JSON stats messages and publishes OSD facts.
  The loop yields on TCP read.
* OSD_THREAD (if OSD is enabled):
  takes `drm_fd`, `output_list` and JSON config as thread parameters,
  receives Facts through mutex-with-timeout-protected `std::queue`, feeds Facts to widgets and
  periodically draws widgets on a buffer inside `output_list` using Cairo library.
  There exists legacy OSD, is based on `osd_vars`, draws using Cairo library, to be removed.
  The loop yields on queue's mutex with timeout (timeout in order to re-draw OSD at fixed intervals).
